> How to improve this project

Either raise things you think need improving, or make a change and submit it.


## Tweepy Discord

If you have a very specific problem to solve, consider asking on the [Tweepy Discord channel](https://discord.gg/bJvqnhg) `#support` section.

If want a tutorial on how to do Direct Messages with Tweepy and this is not covered in this guide yet, then make a request using [Issues](#issues).


## Issues

To request new content or fixes, create an issue on Github here:

- [MichaelCurrin/python-twitter-guide/issues](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/python-twitter-guide/issues)

Please use the labels provided - usually enhancement, bugfix or docs.

Note that any new functionality or bugs around Tweepy itself should go directly to the Tweepy repo issues or the Discord channel.

3. Switch to a feature branch on your fork.
4. Test your changes.
