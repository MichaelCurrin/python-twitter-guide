# Twitter policies

## Why use this guide

A guide to fair use of Twitter and the Twitter API by following their policies. Follow this guide to avoid abusing the API, getting your account rate-limit or blocked or annoying other Twitter users.

Also, when you apply for a developer account, your motivation needs to cover a usercase which is compliant with the policies, otherwise you will not get your application approved.


## Is an action allowed?

When it comes to using the Twitter API and you are **not sure** if an action by your code is allowed by Twitter API, it is safest to be conservative by **not** doing the action and staying well under any limits which might be considered abuse.

Or, check with the Twitter developers or tweepy support group to see if the action is allowed.
