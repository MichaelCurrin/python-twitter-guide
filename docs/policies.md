# Twitter policies

A guide to fair use of Twitter and the Twitter API by following their policies. Follow this guide to avoid abusing the API, getting your account rate-limit or blocked or annoying other Twitter users.

Also, when you apply for a developer account, your motivation needs to cover a use-case which is compliant with the policies, otherwise you will not get your application approved.


## Is an action allowed on the API?

When it comes to using the Twitter API and you are **not sure** if an action by your code is allowed by Twitter API, it is safest to be conservative by **not** doing the action and staying well under any limits which might be considered abuse.

Or, check with the Twitter developers or tweepy support group to see if the action is allowed.


## App restrictions 

Your dev app may get restricted or deactivated if you regularly exceed API limits or do actions not allowed by Twitter policies or do an action which is not covered by your dev application Twitter. Generally you won't have to worry if you are just consuming info. When you start posting or engaging with others using a bot, then you need to be careful that you follow the automation rules.

It is recommended to create a new Twitter account when registering a dev, to avoid your account getting blocked.

Even if you use a browser scraping approach rather than the API, note that Twitter might block your IP address if you do high volume scraping or similar suspicious behavior.
