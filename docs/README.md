## Features

- Unofficial guide to Tweepy.
- Aimed at Python developers using _Tweepy_
    - Tweepy basics (installation and auth)
    - Discover features
    - Learn best practices

Site overview:

Section | Description
---     | ---
[Code snippets](code_snippets.md) | Python code snippets are provided for some common use-cases, to avoid having to look at Tweepy docs or Twitter API docs directly. Links to the original docs are provided in some cases.
[Models](models.md) | Some Tweepy models are covered, to explain the attributes and actions available for objects like tweets and users.
[Twitter Policies](policies.md) | Recommendations and links are provided in this section to help you ensure you use the Twitter API fairly. Especially if you plan to make a bot or want to perform bulk actions but don't your account to be blocked or your dev application to be rejected.

?> **Note:** ðŸš§ This site is an expanding work in progress. I'll be chipping away at adding content around topics like streaming, replies, trends, API policies and available attributes on tweets and users. If you want to see something added, message me directly on Tweepy discord or create / comment on a Github issue [here](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/python-twitter-guide/issues). I'll aim to do the simple additions within a day.

## About
> How to use this guide and why it exists

The Tweepy docs do cover how the library works on the API page, but examples of how to use the library are limited.

Also, the Tweepy library aims to be a _thin layer_ between your code and the Twitter API, so Tweepy does not always make it clear what values are valid in requests. This puts more burden on the developer to figuring things out by looking at both.

So this website aims at making Tweepy and Twitter API easier to use. With additional support by linking to docs and Twitter policies.

?> **Note** This was guide was written main for _Linux_ and _macOS_ systems, so some commands will need to be adjusted to use on Window. In particular any shell commands - Python commands are mostly standard.

## Installation

### Install Tweepy for your own projects

If you are new to Python or virtual environments, read through this guide for more background on the instructions below.

- [Setup a Python 3 virtual environment](https://gist.github.com/MichaelCurrin/3a4d14ba1763b4d6a1884f56a01412b7)


#### Install system dependencies

<!-- TODO: Link to Learn to Code project when links are updated -->

Install [Python 3](python.org/).


#### Install Python packages

```bash
cd my-project
```

Create a virtual environment. Here we use the `venv` tool which built-in for Python 3, but you can use something else.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment.

```bash
# Linux and macOS
source venv/bin/activate
# Windows
source venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install Tweepy into the virtual environment.

```bash
pip install tweepy
```
