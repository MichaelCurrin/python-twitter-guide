## Features of this guide

- This guide is aimed at Python developers who want to use the Twitter API to do automated tasks, like make a bot or download thousands of tweets.
- Unofficial guide to [Tweepy](#tweepy) - a Python library which conveniently wraps the Twitter API, so you can focus on the fun stuff. No experience with Tweepy is needed.
- Find practical solutions for common Tweepy / Twitter API use-cases all in one place - this saves piecing together various docs, examples and tutorials.


## About
> How to use this guide and why it exists

The Tweepy docs do cover how the library works on the API page, but examples of how to use the library are limited.

Also, the Tweepy library aims to be a _thin layer_ between your code and the Twitter API, so Tweepy does not always make it clear what values are valid in requests. This puts more burden on the developer to figuring things out by looking at both.

So this website aims at making Tweepy and Twitter API easier to use. With additional support by linking to docs and Twitter policies.

The content here is from my own experience, what I've learnt from other developers or what I researched to help solve someone's question in the Tweepy discord.
