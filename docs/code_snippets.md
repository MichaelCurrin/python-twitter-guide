# Code snippets
> Common use-cases for Tweepy


This section aims at making at easier by doing that work for you and suggesting a good path, by providing recommended code snippets and samples of the data or returned. This guide is not meant to be complete, but rather to cover typical situations in a way that is easy for beginners to follow.

This based on Tweepy docs, Tweepy code and the Twitter API docs.

?> **Snippet use:**<br>You may copy and paste the code here into your own project and modify it as you need.<br><br>Pasting into a *script* and running is straightforward. But, note that if you paste into the *interactive* Python terminal you may get a syntax error because of the empty lines in functions.


## Installation

### Install Tweepy for your own projects

If you are new to Python or virtual environments, read through this guide for more background on the instructions below.

- [Setup a Python 3 virtual environment](https://gist.github.com/MichaelCurrin/3a4d14ba1763b4d6a1884f56a01412b7)


#### Install system dependencies

<!-- TODO: Link to Learn to Code project when links are updated -->

Install [Python 3](python.org/).


#### Install Python packages

```bash
cd my-project
```

Create a virtual environment. Here we use the `venv` tool which built-in for Python 3, but you can use something else.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment.

```bash
# Linux and macOS
source venv/bin/activate
# Windows
source venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install Tweepy into the virtual environment.

```bash
pip install tweepy
```

Now you can import tweepy within the context of your project's virtual environment.

Use `deactivate` command to revert to the global environment.


## Authorization
> Authenticating with Twitter API using dev account credentials

### Setup credentials

Dummy values:

```python
CONSUMER_KEY = ''
CONSUMER_SECRET = ''
ACCESS_KEY = ''
ACCESS_SECRET = ''
```

Make sure to **never** includes these in version control (repo commits). They can be stored in an unversioned config file (ignored by `.gitignore`) or using environment variables.

A typical config setup would be one of these:

- `.env` - Shell script of properties. Readable from the shell or a Python package (e.g. `dotenv`).
- `config_local.yaml` - A YAML config file. Readable using PyYAML.

### Simple usage

```python
auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(CONSUMER_KEY, CONSUMER_SECRET)
auth.set_access_token(ACCESS_KEY, ACCESS_SECRET)
api = tweepy.API(auth)

api.verify_credentials()
```

### Use a function

Put the logic above in a function. This makes keeps the values out of the global scope and it means it is easy to import and use the function in multiple scripts.

```python
def get_api_connection(consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_key=None,
                       access_secret=None):
    """
    Authorize with Twitter and return API connection object.
    """
    auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(consumer_key, consumer_secret)

    if access_key and access_secret:
        auth.set_access_token(access_key, access_secret)

    api = tweepy.API(auth, wait_on_rate_limit=True, wait_on_rate_limit_notify=True)

    return api


# Example use:
api = get_api_connection(
    CONSUMER_KEY,
    CONSUMER_SECRET,
    ACCESS_KEY,
    ACCESS_SECRET
)
```

If Access credentials are provided, create an App Access Token. Otherwise, create an Application-only Access Token, which has limited context (it can't access a current user), it but different API rate limit restrictions which can be more favorable for certain requests. 

?> Not covered here is the User access token, which requires a user to sign into Twitter and then enter a short code into your application. So that your app can perform actions on their behalf - this flow is unnecessary if you want to make a bot, do bulk retweets as your own bot account or do searches. Rate limiting is on each user. This use flow would require you to setup your own API to handle this complex flow. Or you can enter the code on the command-line and capture using `input()` if you want to try that out locally without the extra setup. 

Then set up an API instance which will automatically wait and print a notification if a rate limit is reached, to avoid getting blocked by the API.

If you are doing automation for a task like search, which doesn't need a concept of "me" as a Twitter account, you can use the "application-only" flow above which does **not** use access details, only consumer details. The drawback is that some methods around `.me` or `.home_timeline` will no longer work, but the advantage is that certain endpoints like `.search` have a higher threshold for rate limiting.

You can start using the application-only approach without hassle, but if you are interested to learn you can read the  [application-only](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/authentication/overview/application-only) doc.

> As this method is specific to the application, it does not involve any users. This method is typically for developers that need read-only access to public information.Â 
>
> API calls using app-only authentication are rate limited per API method at the app level. [source](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/authentication/oauth-2-0)


## Users

### Fetch the profile for the authenticated user

```python
api.me()
```

### Get author of a tweet

```python
tweet.author
```

### Fetch profile

Lookup by Twitter username (screen name).

```python
username = "foo"
user = api.get_user(username)
```

Or lookup by ID. Note we didn't change how we call the method, just a different value was passed in and Tweepy figured out what to do. See [api.get_user](http://docs.tweepy.org/en/v3.8.0/api.html#API.get_user) API reference doc for more info on this.

```python
user_id = "1234567"
user = api.get_user(user_id)
```

Then you can inspect the user object or do actions on it. See the [User](models.md#user) section of the models page.

```python
user.screen_name
# => "foo"
user.followers_count
# => 99
```



## Post tweet

### Message only

```python
msg = 'Hello, world!'

tweet = api.update_status(msg)
```

### Message with media

Upload an image or animated GIF on disk.

```python
media_path = 'foo.gif'
msg = 'Hello, world!'

tweet = api.update_with_media(media_path, status=msg)
```


## Handle time values

Parse a datetime string as returned from Twitter API. Tweepy does not do any logic here, so we convert it into a datetime object to make it more useful.

```python
import datetime


TIME_FORMAT_IN = r"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M%z"


def parse_datetime(value):
    """
    Convert from Twitter datetime string to a datetime object.

    >>> parse_datetime('2020-01-24T08:37:37+00:00')
    datetime.datetime(2020, 1, 24, 8, 37, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc)
    """
    dt = ":".join(value.split(":", 2)[:2])
    tz = value[-6:]
    clean_value = f"{dt}{tz}"

    return datetime.datetime.strptime(clean_value, TIME_FORMAT_IN)
```

?> When splitting, we don't need seconds and any decimals (which have changed style before between API versions). So ignore after the 2nd colon.

?> The value from Twitter will be in GMT zone, regardless of your location or profile settings.

Example usage:

```python
>>> dt = parse_datetime(tweet.created_at())
>>> print(dt.year)
2020
```


## Search API

The Twitter Search API lets you get tweets made in the past 7 to 10 days.

### Query syntax

You can test a search query out in the Twitter search bar before trying it in the API.

Here we choose a high volume term for testing but you can choose anything.

e.g.

```python
query = "python"
```

### Tweepy search method

#### Basic

Return tweets for a search query. Only gives 20 tweets.

```python
tweets = api.search(query)
```

```python
def process_tweet(tweet):
    print(tweet.id)
    print(tweet.text)
    print(tweet.author)
    print()


for tweet in tweets:
    process_tweet(tweet)
```

#### Get more tweets

With search API, you can specify a max of up to `100` items (tweets) per page. The other endpoints like user timelines seem to mostly allow up to `200` items on a page.

```python
tweets = api.search(
    query,
    count=100
)
```

If you want to get the _next_ 100 tweets after that, you could get the ID of the last tweet and use that to start the search at the next page, modified with `since_id=last_tweet_id-1`. You'd also have to check when there are no Tweets left and then stop searching.

However, it is much more practical to use Tweepy's **cursor** approach to do paging.

```python
cursor = tweepy.Cursor(api.search, count=100)
```

In both examples below, we process 500 tweets (assuming there are actually 500 tweets out there matching the search).

```python
for tweet in cursor.items(500):
    process_status(tweet)
```

```python
for page in cursor.pages(5):
    for tweet in page:
        process_status(tweet)
```

Both approaches will get 5 pages from the API and so take the same number of API requests and will give the same tweet results. The difference is that the `.items` approach will add a logic layer so that you only care about tweets and not pages.

?> See [Cursor tutorial](http://docs.tweepy.org/en/latest/cursor_tutorial.html) on Tweepy docs.


#### Extended message

Set `tweet_mode` to `extended`.

- This will give messages that are not truncated (with an ellipsis at the end).
- Note that retweets messages might still be truncated even with this option.
- When using this option, make sure to use the `tweet.full_text` attribute and not `tweet.text`, to avoid an error.

```python
tweets = api.search(
    query,
    tweet_mode="extended"
)
```

#### Result type

Set `result_type` to one of the following, according to Twitter API:

- `recent` - The tweets that are most recent.
- `popular`- The tweets with the highest engagements. Note that this list might be very short - just a few tweets - compared with running the `recent` query query.
- `mixed` - A balance of the other two. Default option.


```python
result_type = "popular"

tweets = api.search(
    query,
    count=100,
    result_type=result_type
)
```
